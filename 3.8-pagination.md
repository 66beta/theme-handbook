#Pagination (In Progress)

Pagination allows your user to page back and forth through multiple pages of content.

WordPress can use pagination when:

- Viewing lists of posts when more posts exist than can fit on one page, or
- Breaking up longer posts by manually by using the `<!--nextpage-->` tag.

##Using Pagination to Navigate Post Lists

The most common use for pagination in WordPress sites is to break up long lists of posts into separate pages. Whether youâ€™re viewing a category, archive, or default index page for a blog or site, WordPress will only show 10 posts per page by default. Users can change the number of posts that appear on each page on the Reading screen (**Admin > Settings > Reading**).

>**Note**: When multiple loops (individual queries for posts) are used in a theme template, only the main loop can be paginated.

##Examples

###Loop with Pagination

This simplified example shows where you can add pagination functions for the main loop. Add the functions just before or after the loop.

```php
<?php if ( have_posts() ) : ?>
    <!-- Add the pagination functions here. -->
    <!-- Start of the main loop. -->
    <?php while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>
    <!-- the rest of your theme's main loop -->
    <?php endwhile; ?>
    <!-- End of the main loop -->
    <!-- Add the pagination functions here. -->
    <div class="nav-previous alignleft)- [<?php next_posts_link( 'Older posts' ); ?></div>
    <div class="nav-next alignright)- [<?php previous_posts_link( 'Newer posts' ); ?></div>
<?php else : ?>
    <p><?php _e('Sorry, no posts matched your criteria.'); ?></p>
<?php endif; ?>
```

###Methods for displaying pagination links

WordPress has numerous functions for displaying links to other pages in your loop. Some of these functions are only used in very specific contexts. You would use a different function on a single post page then you would on a archive page. The following section covers archive template pagination functions. The section after that cover single post pagination.

####Simple Pagination

[post_nav_link](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/posts_nav_link/)

One of the simplest methods is `posts_nav_link()`. Simply place the function in your template after your loop. This generates both links to the next page of posts and previous page of posts where applicable. This function is ideal for themes that have simple pagination requirements.

```php
<?php posts_nav_link(); ?>
```

[next_posts_link](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/next_posts_link/) & [prev_posts_link](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/previous_posts_link/)

When building a theme you may want to have control over where the previous and next posts page link appears. That is when you use `next_posts_link()` and `prev_posts_link()`.

```php
<?php
next_posts_link();
previous_posts_link();
?>
```

If you need to pass the pagination links to a PHP variable you can use [get_next_posts_link()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_next_posts_link/) and [get_previous_posts_link()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_previous_posts_link/).

```php
<?php
$next_posts = get_next_posts_link();
$prev_posts = get_previous_posts_link();
?>
```

####Numerical Pagination

If you want more robust pagination options you can use [the_posts_pagination()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/the_posts_pagination/) if you are using WordPress 4.1 and higher. This will output a set of page numbers with links to previous and next pages of posts.

```php
<?php the_posts_pagination(); ?>
```

####Pagination Between Single Posts

All of the previous functions should be used on index and archive pages. When you are viewing a single blog post you must use prev_post_link and next_post_link. Place the following functions below the loop on your single.php.

```php
<?php
previous_post_link();
next_post_link();
?>
```

###Pagination within a post

WordPress gives you a tag that can be placed in post content to enable pagination for that post, `<!--nextpage-->`. If you use that tag in the content you need to ensure that the [wp_link_pages](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_link_pages/) function is placed in your `single.php` template within the loop.

```php
<?php if ( have_posts() ) : ?>
    <!-- Start of the main loop. -->
    <?php while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>
        <?php the_content(); ?>
        <?php wp_link_pages(); ?>
    <?php endwhile; ?>
<?php endif; ?>
```
