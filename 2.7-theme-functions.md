#Theme Functions

The `functions.php` file is where you add unique functions to your WordPress theme. It can be used to hook into the core functionality of WordPress without editing any core files, and can make your theme more modular, extensible, and functional.

##What is functions.php?

The functions.php file behaves like a WordPress plugin, adding features and functionality to a WordPress site. You can use it to call functions and to define your own functions.

>**Note**:  the same result can be produced using both a plugin or functions.php. If you are creating functionality that should be available no matter what the website looks like, it is best practice to put the functionality in a plugin.

A WordPress plugin:

- requires specific, unique header text
- is stored in wp-content/plugins, usually in a subdirectory
- only executes on page load when activated
- applies to all themes
- should have a single purpose, e.g., convert Posts to Pages, offer search engine optimization features, or help with backups

A functions file:

- requires no unique header text
- is stored in theme’s subdirectory in wp-content/themes
- executes only when in the active theme’s directory
- applies only to that theme. If the theme is changed, the functionality is lost
- can have numerous blocks of code used for many different purposes

Each theme has its own functions file, but only code in the `functions.php` in the active theme is actually run.  If your theme already has a functions file, you can add code to it. If not, you can create a plain-text file named `functions.php` to add to your theme’s directory.

A Child Theme can have its own `functions.php` file. (Please note that, although the child functions file is loaded right before the parent functions file, it does not override the parent file. The child theme’s functions.php file can be used to augment or replace the parent theme’s functions.) Adding a function to the child functions file is a risk-free way to modify a parent theme. That way, when the parent theme is updated, you don’t have to worry about your newly added function disappearing.

With a functions file you can:

- Use WordPress hooks. For example, with the `excerpt_length` filter you can change your post excerpt length (from default of 55 words).
- Enable WordPress features with [add_theme_support()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_theme_support/) to turn on post thumbnails, post formats, and navigation menus.
- Define functions you wish to reuse in multiple theme template files.

>**Note**: When a page is requested, **functions.php** is loaded during theme setup, after any plugin files have loaded.

![Make sense of WP core load](https://developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/basics-theme-functions-01.png)

>**Alert**: If a WordPress plugin calls the same function, or filter, as you do in your functions file, the results can be unexpected — even site disabling.

##Creating functions.php

Creating `functions.php` is easy.

1. Create a new file
2. Add the header
3. Save the file in your theme folder as `functions.php`.

```php
<?php
/**
*  ThemeName functions and definitions
*
*  @package ThemeName
*  @since ThemeName 1.0
*/
?>
```

This comment block describes what the file will do with a brief description.

You should also include the PHPdoc @package and @since, as WordPress does in many theme files, to designate the name of the theme and the version number.

##Theme Setup

There are a number of theme features that you can include within one function. You add these to your functions.php file to active default WordPress features.

>**Note**: It’s important to namespace your functions with your theme name.  Whenever you see `themename_` or `theme_name` be sure to replace with your theme’s name (i.e. `my_custom_theme_setup()` or `my_custom_theme`.

To set this up, start a new function entitled `themename_setup()`

```php
<?php
if ( ! function_exists( 'themename_setup' ) ) :
/**
* Sets up theme defaults and registers support for various WordPress features
*
*  It is important to set up these functions before the init hook so that none of these
*  features are lost.
*
*  @since ThemeName 1.0
*/
function themename_setup() {
?>
```

Some functions are **required** by the Theme Review Guidelines, while others are **recommended**. They will be clearly labeled below.

###Automatic Feed Links

This enables post and comment RSS feeds. These feeds will be displayed in `<head>` automatically. They can be called using `add_theme_support()`. This is **required**.

```php
<?php add_theme_support( 'automatic-feed-links' ); ?>
```

###Navigation Menus

Custom navigation menus allow users to edit and customize menus in the Menus admin panel. This gives users a drag and drop interface to edit the various menus in their theme.

You can set up multiple menus in `functions.php`. They can be added using [register_nav_menus()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_nav_menus/) and inserted into a theme using [wp_nav_menu()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_nav_menu/). If you want to add more than one menu, they should be called in an array. This is recommended.

```php
<?php
register_nav_menus( array(
    'primary'   => __( 'Primary Menu', 'theme_name' ),
    'secondary' => __( 'Secondary Menu', 'theme_name' )
) );
?>
```

These menus will be called by using the name assigned (i.e. primary) as the `theme_location` parameter.

###Load Text Domain

If you choose to make your theme available for translation, and it is highly recommended that you do, you can make your themes strings available for translation using [load_theme_textdomain()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/load_theme_textdomain/). Translation files can then be added to the `/languages` directory in your root. Check out the section on internationalization for more information. This is recommended.

```php
<?php load_theme_textdomain( 'Theme_Name', get_template_directory() . '/languages' ); ?>
```

###Post Thumbnails

Post Thumbnails, or Featured Images, allow your users to choose an image to represent their post. They can be displayed in your theme in a variety of ways, such as displaying it within an array of posts along with title, author, an excerpt, or by using it as a big featured image on your homepage. You can use `add_theme_support()` to add post thumbnails to your theme. This is **recommended**.

```php
<?php add_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' ); ?>
```

###Post Formats

Post Formats allow users to format their posts in different ways. This is useful for allowing bloggers to choose different formats and templates based on the content of the post. `add_theme_support()` is also used for Post Formats. This is recommended.

```php
<?php add_theme_support( 'post-formats',  array ( 'aside', 'gallery', 'quote', 'video' ) ); ?>
```

###Initial Setup

If you choose to include all of the above functions, then the beginning of your `functions.php` file will look like this.

```php
<?php
if ( ! function_exists( 'themename_setup' ) ) :
/**
 * Sets up theme defaults and registers support for various WordPress features.
 *
 * Note that this function is hooked into the after_setup_theme hook, which runs
 * before the init hook. The init hook is too late for some features, such as indicating
 * support post thumbnails.
 */
function themename_setup() {
    /**
     * Make theme available for translation
     * Translations can be filed in the /languages/ directory
     */
    load_theme_textdomain( 'theme_name', get_template_directory() . '/languages' );
    /**
     * Add default posts and comments RSS feed links to head
     */
    add_theme_support( 'automatic-feed-links' );
    /**
     * Enable support for Post Thumbnails
     */
    add_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' );
    /**
     * This theme has two nav menus
     */
    register_nav_menus( array(
        'primary'   => __( 'Primary Menu', 'theme_name' ),
        'secondary' => __('Secondary Menu', 'theme_name' )
    ) );
    /**
     * Enable support for the Post Formats aside, gallery, quote and video
     */
    add_theme_support( 'post-formats', array ( 'aside', 'gallery', 'quote', 'video' ) );
}
endif; // themename_setup
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'themename_setup' );
?>
```

##Sidebars

Sidebars are an important part of your theme. They are areas that users can customize using widgets through the widgets admin panel. Widgets can be used for a variety of purposes, ranging from listing recent posts to conducting live chats.

>**Tip**: The name “sidebars” comes from a time when widget areas were normally created in a long strip to the lefthand or righthand side of a blog. Today, sidebars have evolved beyond their original name. They can be included anywhere on your website. Think of a sidebar as **any area that contains widgets**.

To use sidebars, you must register them in `functions.php`. This is a **required** step by the theme review guidelines.

To begin, [register_sidebar()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_sidebar/) has several parameters which must be defined. These are all optional, but are all recommended.

- `name` – your name for the sidebar. This is the name users will see in the Widgets panel.
- `id` – must be lowercase. You will call this in your theme using the dynamic_sidebar function.
- `description` – A description of the sidebar. This will also be shown in the admin Widgets panel.
- `class` – The CSS class name to assign to the widget’s HTML.
- `before_widget` – HTML that is placed before every widget.
- `after_widget` – HTML that is placed after every widget. Should be used to close tags from `before_widget`.
- `before_title` – HTML that is placed before the title of each widget, such as a header tag.
- `after_title` – HTML that is placed after every title. Should be used to close tags from `before_title`.

To register a sidebar we use `register_sidebar` and the [widgets_init](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/widgets_init/) function.

```php
<?php
function themename_widgets_init() {
    register_sidebar( array(
        'name'          => __( 'Primary Sidebar', 'theme_name' ),
        'id'            => 'sidebar-1',
        'before_widget' => '</pre><aside id="%1$s" class="widget %2$s">',
        'after_widget'  => '</aside><pre>',
        'before_title'  => '</pre><h1 class="widget-title">',
        'after_title'   => '</h1><pre>',
    ) );
    register_sidebar( array(
        'name'          => __( 'Secondary Sidebar', 'theme_name' ),
        'id'            => 'sidebar-2',
        'before_widget' => '</pre><ul><li id="%1$s" class="widget %2$s">',
        'after_widget'  => '</li></ul><pre>',
        'before_title'  => '</pre><h3 class="widget-title">',
        'after_title'   => '</h3><pre>',
    ) );
}
add_action( 'widgets_init', 'themename_widgets_init' );
?>
```

Once your sidebar is registered, you can display it in your theme.

##Custom Header

Custom headers allow site owners to upload their own “title” image to their site, which can be placed at the top of certain pages. These can be customized and cropped by the user through a visual editor in the **Appearance > Header** section of the admin panel. You may also place text beneath or on top of the header. To support fluid layouts and responsive design, these headers may also be flexible. Headers are placed into a theme using [get_custom_header()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_custom_header/), but they must first be added to your functions.php file using `add_theme_support()`. Custom headers are optional.

Custom headers are quite extensive, so it is recommended that you read more about them in the custom headers  section if you would like to include them, but in order to set up a basic, flexible, custom header with text you would include the following code:

```php
<?php
function themename_custom_header_setup() {
    $args = array(
        'default-image'      => get_template_directory_uri() . 'img/default-image.jpg',
        'default-text-color' => '000',
        'width'              => 1000,
        'height'             => 250,
        'flex-width'         => true,
        'flex-height'        => true,
    )
    add_theme_support( 'custom-header', $args );
}
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'themename_custom_header_setup' );
?>
```

>**note**: The [after_setup_theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/after_setup_theme/) hook is used so that custom headers are registered upon the themes activation.

To ensure backwards compatibility, you must also include `add_custom_image_header()` which will support all versions of WordPress prior to 3.4. Fortunately, it is easy to use the same parameters set by the initial custom header setup, and use `version_compare` to check which version of WordPress is being used.

```php
<?php
function themename_custom_header_setup() {
    global $wp_version;
    $args = array(
        'default-image'      => get_template_directory_uri() . 'img/default-image.jpg',
        'default-text-color' => '000',
        'width'              => 1000,
        'height'             => 250,
        'flex-width'         => true,
        'flex-height'        => true,
    )
    if ( version_compare( $wp_version, '3.4', '>=' ) ) {
        add_theme_support( 'custom-header', $args );
    } else {
        define( 'HEADER_TEXTCOLOR',    $args['default-text-color'] );
        define( 'HEADER_IMAGE',        $args['default-image'] );
        define( 'HEADER_IMAGE_WIDTH',  $args['width'] );
        define( 'HEADER_IMAGE_HEIGHT', $args['height'] );
        add_custom_image_header( $wp_head_callback, $admin_head_callback );
        }
}
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'themename_custom_header_setup' );
?>
```

##Custom Background

You can also add a custom background so that users can choose a custom background color or image for their site. Like custom headers, a custom background can be added with `add_theme_support` with similar parameters. It is also necessary to add backwards compatibility. This is also optional.

```php
<?php
function themename_register_custom_background() {
    $args = array(
        'default-color' => 'ffffff',
        'default-image' =>  ' ',
    );
    if ( version_compare( $wp_version, '3.4', '>=' ) ) {
        add_theme_support( 'custom-background', $args ):
    } else {
        add_custom_background();
    }
}
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'themename_register_custom_background' );
?>
```

##Add Editor Style

The [add_editor_style](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_editor_style/) can be used to add a special CSS stylesheet to the TinyMCE visual editor. The only parameter to define in this function is the path to the stylesheet file, though if none is specified, “editor-style.css” is used by default.

```php
<?php
function themename_add_editor_styles() {
    add_editor_style( 'custom-editor-style.css' );
}
add_action ( 'admin_init', 'themename_add_editor_styles' );
?>
```

##Content Width

You may set a custom maximum width in your functions.php file. This will set a maximum allowed width for any content added theme, including uploaded images. This is useful if you wish to ensure that no assets or content will break their container. This is optional.

```php
<?php
if ( ! isset ( $content_width) )
    $content_width = 640;
?>
```

##Your functions.php File

If you choose to include all of the functions listed above, this is what your `functions.php` might look like. It has been commented with references to above.
