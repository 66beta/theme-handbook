#Theme Basics

In this section, you’ll build on that theme by adding new features to your theme and learning how to build a theme properly. You’ll begin by looking at how you can break [theme files and templates](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/theme-files-organization/) down into smaller, reusable pieces. Then, you’ll learn how to keep your files organized within your theme.

You’ll also look at **The Loop**, which is responsible for pulling content out of the WordPress database.

Finally, you’ll learn more about adding features to your theme by **using theme functions**, **including CSS & JavaScript**, and leveraging **conditional tags** to only show content you need.

##Template Files

Template files are used throughout WordPress themes, but first let’s learn about the terminology.

###Template Terminology

The term “template” is used in different ways when working with WordPress themes:

- Templates are the files within your [WordPress Theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes) that control how your site is displayed in the browser. This page discusses templates, generally.
- Page Templates are a type of template that are applied only to pages to change their look and feel.  A page template can be applied to a single page, a page section, or a class of pages.
- Template Tags are built-in WordPress functions you can use inside a template file to retrieve and display data (such as [the_title()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/the_title/) and [the_content()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/the_content/)).
- Template Hierarchy is the logic WordPress uses to decide which theme template file(s) to use, depending on the content being requested.

###Template files

WordPress themes are made up of template files. These are PHP files that contain a mixture of HTML, **WordPress Template Tags**, and PHP.

When you are building your theme, you will use template files to affect the layout and design of different parts of your website. For example, you would use the `header.php` template to create a header, or the `comments.php` template to include comments.

When someone visits a page on your website, WordPress generates the page based on the template files that are included in your theme. Next, the server parses the PHP in the required templates and returns HTML to the visitor’s web browser, which renders the page.

As mentioned previously in What is a Theme?, the most critical template file is `index.php`, but you’ll often find other templates in a theme such as:

- `header.php` for generating the site’s header
- `footer.php` for generating the footer
- `sidebar.php` for generating the sidebar
While the above PHP template files apply to one section of a page, templates are also used to control how different types of content are displayed on your website, as described on page discussing page templates.

###Why use separate template files?

One of the principles of good development is to not repeat yourself. For example, if you have three different files that all use the same header, any change in the header will require a change in all three files. Not only does this get tedious, but it is prone to error.

As a theme continues to grow in complexity, its `index.php` file can become difficult to manage. In addition, a single large template file may increase load times in the browser, slowing down your site.

With template files, your website is broken down into logical, reusable chunks. This means you only have to maintain one file for each component of your website, and ensures a better experience for site visitors.

###Tutorial: Create Template Files for Your Theme

Now it’s time to add some more standards files to the theme that you started in Your First Theme.  While many themes have around 30+ files, you’ll start by adding just 5 new files to your theme. Right now your theme should have `index.php` and `style.css`.

You’re going to create the following files.  Most are self-explanatory from their name alone. This section will only cover creating the files, you’ll find out more about how the code works in later sections.

- `header.php` – generates the header(s) for all your theme’s pages
- `footer.php` – generates the footer(s) for all your theme’s pages
- `page.php` – generates a static page
- `home.php` – generates your main blog posts page
- `single.php` – generates a single blog post

The tutorial follows these broad steps:

1. Breaking the code contained in `index.php` into modular parts (i.e. the header and footer)
2. Using a template tag in `index.php` to include these modular parts
3. Duplicating your `index.php` file to use as the basis for other parts of your theme (your homepage, single post, and static page)

####Header.php

1. Open the theme folder you created in Your First Theme in `wp-content/themes/my-first-theme`.
2. Create a new file called header.php.
3. Open the index.php file and cut out the following code. It’s important that you cut the code, don’t just copy it, as you’re going to place it in the new file.

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
     <meta charset="<?php bloginfo( 'charset' ); ?>">
     <title><?php wp_title( '|', true, 'right' ); ?></title>
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="<?php echo esc_url( get_stylesheet_uri() ); ?>" type="text/css" />
     <?php wp_head(); ?>
 </head>
 <body>
     <h1><?php bloginfo( 'name' ); ?></h1>
     <h2><?php bloginfo( 'description' ); ?></h2>
 ```
4. Paste the code into `header.php` file. Save both files.

####Footer.php

1. Create a `footer.php` file.
2. Cut out the following code from your index.php file:

```php
    <?php wp_footer(); ?>
    </body>
</html>
```
3. Paste the code into your footer.php file. Save both files.

####Update Index.php

Now that you’ve pulled out the header and footer sections of code from your `index.php` file you need to add 2 codes snippets for your `index.php` file to include the `header.php` and `footer.php` files.

1. Add this to the very top of your index.php file.

```php
<?php get_header(); ?>
```
2. Add this to the very bottom of the file.

```php
<?php get_footer(); ?>
```

These two snippets of code are examples of template tags which you can read more about later.

####Page.php, Home.php, & Single.php

Finally, open your `index.php` file and “save as” `page.php`, repeat to create `home.php` and `single.php`.

>**Note**: Even though `index.php`, `page.php`, `home.php` and `single.php` all are identical code right now, `page.php`, `home.php`, and `single.php` will render pages differently just by the way WordPress interprets the type of template file that they are.

You’ll eventually tweak each of theses files to make them unique.

###Common WordPress template files

Below is a list of some basic theme templates and files recognized by WordPress. Of course, your theme may contain any stylesheets, images, and files.

Keep in mind that the following files have special meaning to WordPress – see the article on the template hierarchy for more information.

- `index.php` The main template file. It is **required** in all themes.
- `style.css` The main stylesheet. It is **required** in all themes and contains the information header for your theme.
- `rtl.css` The right-to-left stylesheet is included automatically if the website language’s text direction is right-to-left.
- `comments.php` The comments template.
- `front-page.php` The front page template is only used if you use a static front page, which is set in WordPress under `Admin > Settings > Reading`.
- `home.php` The home page template is the front page by default. If you do not set WordPress to use a static front page, this template is used to show latest posts.
- `header.php` The header template file usually contains your site’s document type, meta information, links to stylesheets and scripts, and other data.
- `single.php` The single post template is used when a visitor requests a single post. For this, and all other query templates, `index.php` is used if the query template is not present.
- `single-{post-type}.php` The single post template used when a visitor requests a single post from a custom post type. For example, `single-book.php` would be used for displaying single posts from a custom post type named book. The `index.php` is used if a specific query template for the custom post type is not present.
- `archive-{post-type}.php` The archive post type template is used when visitors request a custom post type archive. For example, `archive-books.php` would be used for displaying an archive of posts from the custom post type named books. The archive.php template file is used if the `archive-{post-type}.php` is not present.
- `page.php` The page template is used when visitors request individual pages, which are a built-in template.
- `page-{slug}.php` The page slug template is used when visitors request a specific page, for example one with the “about” slug (page-about.php).
- `category.php` The category template is used when visitors request posts by category.
- `tag.php` The tag template is used when visitors request posts by tag.
- `taxonomy.php` The taxonomy term template is used when a visitor requests a term in a custom taxonomy.
- `author.php` The author page template is used whenever a visitor loads an author page.
- `date.php` The date/time template is used when posts are requested by date or time. For example, the pages generated with these slugs:`http://example.com/blog/2014/, http://example.com/blog/2014/05/, http://example.com/blog/2014/05/26/`
```
- `archive.php` The archive template is used when visitors request posts by category, author, or date. **Note**: this template will be overridden if more specific templates are present like `category.php`, `author.php`, and `date.php`.
- `search.php` The search results template is used to display a visitor’s search results.
- `attachment.php` The attachment template is used when viewing a single attachment like an image, pdf, or other media file.
- `image.php` The image attachment template is a more specific version of `attachment.php` and is used when viewing a single image attachment. If not present, WordPress will use `attachment.php` instead.
- `404.php` The 404 template is used when WordPress cannot find a post, page, or other content that matches the visitor’s request.

###Using template files

Within WordPress templates, you can use Template Tags to display information dynamically, include other template files, or otherwise customize your site.

For example, in your `index.php` you can include other files in your final generated page:

- To include the header, use [get_header()](http://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_header/)
- To include the sidebar, use [get_sidebar()](http://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_sidebar/)
- To include the footer, use [get_footer()](http://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_footer/)
- To include the search form, use [get_search_form()](http://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_search_form/)
- To include custom theme files, use [get_template_part()](http://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_template_part/)

Here is an example of WordPress template tags to include specific templates into your page:

```php
<?php get_sidebar(); ?>
<?php get_template_part( 'featured-content' ); ?>
<?php get_footer(); ?>
```

There’s an entire page on Template Tags that you can dive into to learn all about them.

##Theme Files & Organization

While WordPress themes technically only require two files (`index.php` and `style.css`), they usually are made up of many files. That means they can quickly become disorganized! This section will show you how to keep your files organized.

###Theme folder and file structure

As mentioned previously, the default Twenty themes are some of the best examples of good theme development. For instance, here is how the [Twenty Twelve theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwelve/) organizes its [file structure](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-content/themes/twentytwelve):

```
css (dir)
inc (dir)
js (dir)
languages (dir)
page-templates (dir)
404.php
archive.php
author.php
category.php
comments.php
content.php
content-aside.php
content-image.php
content-link.php
content-none.php
content-page.php
content-quote.php
content-status.php
editor-style-rtl.css
editor-style.css
footer.php
functions.php
header.php
image.php
index.php
page.php
rtl.css
screenshot.png
search.php
sidebar.php
sidebar-front.php
single.php
style.css
tag.php
```

You can see that the main theme template files are in the root directory, while JavaScript, languages, CSS, and page template files are placed in their own folders.

At this time there are **no required folders within a WordPress theme**. However, WordPress does recognize the following folders by default.

###Page templates folder

Custom page templates have their own directory, `page-templates`, which allows for better organization of page template files. Custom page templates are page templates that can be applied to individual pages to change their design and layout (more on those later!) Custom page templates in this folder are automatically recognized by WordPress.

###Languages folder

It’s best practice to internationalize your theme so it can be translated into other languages. Default themes include the `languages` folder, which contains a .pot file for translation and any translated .mo files. While `languages` is the default name of this folder, you can change the name. If you do so, you must update [load_theme_textdomain()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/load_theme_textdomain/).


##Template Hierarchy

As discussed, template files are modular, reusable files, used to generate the web pages on your WordPress site. Some template files (such as the header and footer template) are used on all of your site’s pages, while others are used only under specific conditions.

This article explains **how WordPress determines which template file(s) to use on individual pages**. If you want to customize an existing WordPress theme it will help you decide which template file needs to be edited.

>**Tip**: Tou can also use Conditional Tags to control which templates are loaded on a specific page.

###The Template File Hierarchy

####Overview

WordPress uses the [query string](http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Query_String) to decide which template or set of templates should be used to display the page. The query string is information that is contained in the link to each part of your website. It comes after the initial question mark and may contain a number of parameters separated by ampersands.

Put simply, WordPress searches down through the template hierarchy until it finds a matching template file. To determine which template file to use, WordPress:

- Matches every query string to a query type to decide which page is being requested (for example, a search page, a category page, etc);
- Selects the template in the order determined by the template hierarchy;
- Looks for template files with specific names in the current theme’s directory and uses the **first matching template file** as specified by the hierarchy.

With the exception of the basic `index.php` template file, you can choose whether you want to implement a particular template file or not.

If WordPress cannot find a template file with a matching name, it will skip to the next file in the hierarchy. If WordPress cannot find any matching template file, the theme’s index.php file will be used.

####Examples

If your blog is at `http://example.com/blog/` and a visitor clicks on a link to a category page such as `http://example.com/blog/category/your-cat/`, WordPress looks for a template file in the current theme’s directory that matches the category’s ID to generate the correct page. More specifically, WordPress follows this procedure:

1. Looks for a template file in the current theme’s directory that matches the category’s slug. If the category slug is “unicorns,” then WordPress looks for a template file named `category-unicorns.php`.
2. If `category-unicorns.php` is missing and the category’s ID is 4, WordPress looks for a template file named `category-4.php`.
3. If `category-4.php` is missing, WordPress will look for a generic category template file, `category.php`.
4. If `category.php` does not exist, WordPress will look for a generic archive template, `archive.php`.
5. If `archive.php` is also missing, WordPress will fall back to the main theme template file, `index.php`.

####Visual Overview

The following diagram shows which template files are called to generate a WordPress page based on the WordPress template hierarchy.
