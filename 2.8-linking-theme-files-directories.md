#Linking Theme Files & Directories

##Linking to Core Theme Files

As you’ve learned, WordPress themes are built from a number of different template files. At the very least this will usually include a `sidebar.php`, `header.php` and `footer.php`. These are called using Template Tags, for example:

- [get_header()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_header/)
- [get_footer()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_footer/)
- [get_sidebar()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_sidebar/)

You can create custom versions of these files can be called as well by naming the file `sidebar-{your_custom_template}.php`, `header-{your_custom_template}.php` and `footer-{your_custom_template}.php`. You can then use Template Tags with the custom template name as the only parameter, like this:

- `get_header( 'your_custom_template' );`
- `get_footer( 'your_custom_template' );`
- `get_sidebar( 'your_custom_template' );`

WordPress creates pages by assembling various files. Aside from the standard files for the header, footer and sidebar, you can create custom template files and call them at any location in the page using [get_template_part()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_template_part/). To create a custom template file in your theme give the file an appropriate name and use the same custom template system as with the header, sidebar and footer files: `slug-template.php`

For example, if you would like to create a custom template to handle your post content you could create a template file called `content.php` and then add a specific content layout for product content by extending the file name to `content-product.php`. You would then load this template file in your theme like this: `get_template_part( 'content', 'product' );`

If you want to add more organization to your templates, you can place them in their own directories within your theme directory. For example, suppose you add a couple more content templates for profiles and locations, and group them in their own directory called `content-templates`.

The theme hierarchy for your theme called my-theme might look like the following. `style.css` and `page.php` are included for context.

- themes
    - my-theme
        - content-templates
            - content-location.php
            - content-product.php
            - content-profile.php
        - style.css

To include your content templates, prepend the directory names to the slug argument like this:

- `get_template_part( 'content-templates/content', 'location' );`
- `get_template_part( 'content-templates/content', 'product' );`
- `get_template_part( 'content-templates/content', 'profile' );`

##Linking to Theme Directories

To link to the theme’s directories, you can use the following functions:

- [get_template_directory_uri()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_template_directory_uri/)
- [get_stylesheet_directory_uri()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_stylesheet_directory_uri/)

If you are not using a child theme both of these functions will return the same thing – the full URI to your theme’s main folder. You can use this to reference sub-folders in your theme like this:

```php
<?php echo get_template_directory_uri() . '/images/logo.png'; ?>
```

If you are using a child theme then `get_stylesheet_directory_uri()` will return the URI of your child theme, while `get_template_directory_uri()` will return the URI of your parent theme. This is particularly important to keep in mind when distributing a theme or in any other case where a child theme may or may not be active.

##Dynamic Linking in Templates

Regardless of your permalink settings, you can link to a page or post dynamically by referring to its unique numerical ID (seen in several pages in the admin interface) with `<a href="<?php echo get_permalink(ID); ?>">This is a link</a>`

This is a convenient way to create page menus as you can later change page slugs without breaking links, as IDs will stay the same. However, this might increase database queries.

Dynamic page menus can also be created by utilizing Template_Tags/wp_list_pages child_of parameter or some of the many available plugins.
