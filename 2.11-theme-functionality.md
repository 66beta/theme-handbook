#Theme Functionality

##Custom Headers

###What are Custom Headers?

When you enable Custom Headers in your theme, users can change their header image using the WordPress theme Customizer. This gives users more control and flexibility over the look of their site.

###Add Custom Header Support to your Theme

To enable Custom Headers in your theme, add the following to your functions.php file:

```php
<?php add_theme_support( 'custom-header' ); ?>
```

When enabling Custom Headers, you can configure several other options by passing along arguments to the `add_theme_support()` function.

You can pass specific configuration options to the `add_theme_support` function using an array:

```php
<?php
$defaults = array(
    'default-image'          => '',
    'random-default'         => false,
    'width'                  => 0,
    'height'                 => 0,
    'flex-height'            => false,
    'flex-width'             => false,
    'default-text-color'     => '',
    'header-text'            => true,
    'uploads'                => true,
    'wp-head-callback'       => '',
    'admin-head-callback'    => '',
    'admin-preview-callback' => '',
);
add_theme_support( 'custom-header', $defaults );
?>
```

In the above case, the default array values are assigned to a variable called `$defaults`.

###Examples

####Set a custom header image

When the user first installs your theme, you can include a default header that will be selected before they choose their own header. This allows users to set up your theme more quickly and use your default image until they’re ready to upload their own.

Set a default header image 980px width and 60px height:

```php
<?php
$args = array(
    'width'         => 980,
    'height'        => 60,
    'default-image' => get_template_directory_uri() . '/images/header.jpg',
);
add_theme_support( 'custom-header', $args );
?>
```

####Use flexible headers

By default, the user will have to crop any images they upload to fit in the width and height you specify. However, you can let users upload images of any height and width by specifying ‘flex-width’ and ‘flex-height’ as true. This will let the user skip the cropping step when they upload a new photo.

Set flexible headers:

```php
<?php
$args = array(
    'flex-width'    => true,
    'width'         => 980,
    'flex-height'    => true,
    'height'        => 200,
    'default-image' => get_template_directory_uri() . '/images/header.jpg',
);
add_theme_support( 'custom-header', $args );
?>
```

update your `header.php` file to:

```php
<img alt="" src="<?php header_image(); ?>" width="<?php echo get_custom_header()->width; ?>" height="<?php echo get_custom_header()->height; ?>" />
```

####Header text

By default, the user will have the option of whether or not to display header text over the image. There is no option to force the header text on the user, but if you want to remove the header text completely, you can set ‘header-text’ to ‘false’ in the arguments. This will remove the header text and the option to toggle it.

###Backwards Compatibility

Custom Headers are supported in WordPress 3.4 and above. If you’d like your theme to support WordPress installations that are older than 3.4, you can use the following code instead of `add_theme_support( ‘custom-header’)`;

```php
<?php
global $wp_version;
if ( version_compare( $wp_version, '3.4', '>=' ) ) :
    add_theme_support( 'custom-header' );
else :
    add_custom_image_header( $wp_head_callback, $admin_head_callback );
endif;
?>
```

##Sidebars

A sidebar is any widgetized area of your theme. Widget areas are places in your theme where users can add their own widgets. Widget areas are called sidebars because they were first introduced as right or left-hand sidebar on a blog. However, there are no limitations on where a sidebar can be and theme developers create sidebars in many different places on a website. You may, for example, wish to populate the content of your theme’s homepage using widgets instead of static content or a loop.

###Registering a Sidebar

Registering a sidebar tells WordPress that you’re creating a new widget area in **Appearance > Widgets** that users can drag their widgets to. There are two functions for registering sidebars:

- [register_sidebar()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_sidebar/)
- [register_sidebars()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_sidebars/)

The first lets you register one sidebar, with the second you can register multiple sidebars.

It is recommended that you register sidebars individually as it allows you to give unique and descriptive names to each sidebar.

For example, if you have widget areas in your header and footer, it makes sense to name them “Header Widget Area” and “Footer Widget Area”, rather than “Sidebar 1″ and “Sidebar 2″(which is the default). This gives the user a useful description of the sidebar, telling them where the sidebar is located on the page.

The following code, added to `functions.php` registers a sidebar:

```php
<?php
add_action( 'widgets_init', 'my_register_sidebars' );
function my_register_sidebars() {
        /* Register the 'primary' sidebar. */
    register_sidebar(
        array(
            'id' => 'primary',
            'name' => __( 'Primary Sidebar' ),
            'description' =>; __( 'A short description of the sidebar.' ),
            'before_widget' => '<div id="%1$s" class="widget %2$s">',
            'after_widget' => '</div>',
            'before_title' => '<h3 class="widget-title">',
            'after_title' => '</h3>',
        )
    );
    /* Repeat register_sidebar() code for additional sidebars. */
}
?>
```

The code does the following:

- `register_sidebar` – tells WordPress that you’re registering a sidebar
- `'name' => __( 'Primary Widget Area', 'mytheme' )` – is the widget area’s name that will appear in **Appearance > Widgets**
- `'id' => 'sidebar-1'` – assigns an ID to the sidebar. WordPress uses this to assign widgets to a specific sidebar
- `before_widget/after_widget` – a wrapper element for widgets assigned to the sidebar. The `%1$s` and `%2$s` should always be left in `id` and `class` respectively so that plugins can make use of them. By default, WordPress sets these as list items but in the above example they have been altered to div
- `before_title/after_title` – the wrapper elements for the widget’s title. By default, WordPress sets it to `h2` but using `h3` makes it more semantic.

###Displaying Sidebars in your Theme

Now that your sidebars are registered, you will want to display them in your theme. To do this, there are two steps:

1. Create the `sidebar.php` template file and display the sidebar using the [dynamic_sidebar](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/dynamic_sidebar/) function
2. Load in your theme using the [get_sidebar](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_sidebar/) function

####Create a Sidebar Template File

A sidebar template contains all of the code for your sidebar. WordPress recognizes the file sidebar.php and any template file with the name `sidebar-{name}.php`. This means that you can organize your files with each sidebar in its own template file.

For the above example, you should follow the above process for creating your sidebar file:

1. Create `sidebar-primary.php`
2. Add the following code:

```php
<div id="sidebar-primary" class="sidebar">
    <?php dynamic_sidebar( 'primary' ); ?>
</div>
```

>**Note**: that `dynamic_sidebar` takes a single parameter of `$index`, which can be either the sidebar’s `name` or `id`.

####Load your Sidebar

To load your sidebar in your theme, use the `get_sidebar` function. This should be inserted into the template file where you want the sidebar to display. To load the default `sidebar.php` use the following:

```php
<?php get_sidebar(); ?>
```

To display the Primary sidebar (per the above example), pass the `$name` parameter to the function:

```php
<?php get_sidebar( 'primary' ); ?>

```

###Customizing your Sidebar

There are lots of ways that you can customize your sidebars. Here are some examples:

####Display Default Sidebar Content

You may wish to display content if the user hasn’t added any widgets to the sidebar yet. To do this, you use the [is_active_sidebar()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/is_active_sidebar/) function to check to see if the sidebar has any widgets. This accepts the $index parameter which should be the ID of the sidebar that you wish to check.

This code checks to see if the sidebar is active, if not it displays some content:

```php
<div id="sidebar-primary" class="sidebar">
    <?php if ( is_active_sidebar( 'primary' ) ) : ?>
        <?php dynamic_sidebar( 'primary' ); ?>
    <?php else : ?>
        <!-- Time to add some widgets! -->
    <?php endif; ?>
</div>
```

####Display Default Widgets

You may want your sidebar to be populated with some widgets by default. To do this you would use:

```php
<div id="primary" class="sidebar">
    <?php do_action( 'before_sidebar' ); ?>
    <?php if ( ! dynamic_sidebar( 'sidebar-primary' ) ) : ?>
        <aside id="search" class="widget widget_search">
           <?php get_search_form(); ?>
        </aside>
        <aside id="archives" class"widget">
            <h1 class="widget-title"><?php _e( 'Archives', 'shape' ); ?></h1>
            <ul>
                <?php wp_get_archives( array( 'type' => 'monthly' ) ); ?>
            </ul>
        </aside>
        <aside id="meta" class="widget">
            <h1 class="widget-title"><?php _e( 'Meta', 'shape' ); ?></h1>
            <ul>
                <?php wp_register(); ?>
                <li><?php wp_loginout(); ?></li>
                <?php wp_meta(); >
            </ul>
        </aside>
   <?php endif; ?>
</div>
```

This displays the Search, Archive, and Meta Widgets.

##Widgets

A widget adds content and features to a widget area (also called a sidebar). Widget areas provide a way for users to customize their site. A widget area can appear on multiple pages, or just on one page. Your theme might have just one widget area or many of them. Some examples of ways you can use widget areas are:

- Lay out a homepage using widgets. This allows site owners to decide what should appear in each section of their homepage.
- Create a footer that users can customize with their own content.
- Add a cuztomizable sidebar to a blog.

A widget is a PHP object that outputs some HTML. The same widget type can be used multiple times on the same page (e.g. the Text Widget). Widgets can save data in the database (in the options table).

When you create a new widget type, it will appear in the user’s Administration Screens at **Appearance > Widgets**. The user can add the widget to a widget area, and customize the widget settings from the WordPress admin.

###Built-in versus stand-alone widgets

A set of widgets is included with the default WordPress installation. In addition to these standard widgets, extra widgets can be included by themes or plugins. An advantage of widgets built into themes or plugins is to provide extra features and increase the number of widgets.

A disadvantage is that if a theme is changed or a plugin is deactivated, the plugin or theme widget’s functionality will be lost. However, the data and preferences from the widget will be saved to the options table and restored if the theme or plugin is reactivated.

If you include a widget with your theme, it can only be used if that theme is active. If the user decides to change their theme they will lose access to that widget. However, if the widget is included with a plugin, the user can change their theme without losing access to the widget functionality.

###Anatomy of a Widget #

Visually, a widget comprises two areas:

1. Title Area
2. Widget Options

For example, here is the layout of the built-in text widget in the admin and on the front-end:

![A widget form in the admin area.](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/files/2013/06/widget_visual.png)
![A widget as it appears to a site visitor.](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/files/2013/06/Widget-front-end.png)

The HTML output for this widget looks like this:

```html
<div id="text-7" class="widget widget_text"> <!-- Widget Container -->
    <div class="widget-wrap">
        <h4 class="widgettitle">This is a text widget</h4> <!-- Title -->
        <div class="textwidget"> <!-- Content of Widget -->
                   I can put HTML in here.
           <a href="http://google.com">Search me!</a>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

Each widget has its own way of outputting HTML that is relevant to the data being displayed. The wrapper tags for the widget are defined by the widget area in which it is being displayed.

###Developing Widgets

To create and display a widget, you need to do the following:

1. Create your widget’s class by extending the standard WP_Widget class and some of its functions.
2. Register your widget so that it’s made available in the **Widgets** screen.
3. Make sure that your theme has at least one widget area in which to add the widgets.

####Your Widget Class

The WP_Widget class is located in [wp-includes/widgets.php](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.5.1/wp-includes/widgets.php#L0)

```php
<?php
class My_Widget extends WP_Widget {
    public function __construct() {
        // actual widget processes
    }
    public function widget( $args, $instance ) {
        // outputs the content of the widget
    }
    public function form( $instance ) {
        // outputs the options form in the admin
    }
    public function update( $new_instance, $old_instance ) {
        // processes widget options to be saved
    }
}
?>
```

The documentation for each of these functions can be found in the widget class code:

1. [__construct](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.5.2/wp-includes/widgets.php#L81): Set up your widget with a description, name, and display width in your admin.
2. [widget](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.5.2/wp-includes/widgets.php#L44): Process the widget options and display the HTML on your page. The `$args` parameter provides the HTML you can use to display the widget title class and widget content class.
3. [form](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.5.2/wp-includes/widgets.php#L66): Display the form that will be used to set the options for your widget. If your widget doesn’t have any options, you can skip this function (although it is still best practice to include it even if it’s empty).
4. [update](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.5.2/wp-includes/widgets.php#L58): Save the widget options to the database. If your widget doesn’t have any options, you can skip this function (although it is still best practice to include it even if it’s empty).

####Registering a Widget

The [register_widget()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_widget/) function is used to register a widget.

Call this function using the `widgets_init` hook:

```php
<?php add_action( 'widgets_init', function() { register_widget( 'My_Widget' ); } ); ?>
```

The HTML that wraps the widget, as well as the class for the title and widget content, is specified at the time you register the widget area using [register_sidebar()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_sidebar/).

###Examples

####Sample Widget

```php
<?php
/**
 * Adds Foo_Widget widget.
 */
class Foo_Widget extends WP_Widget {
    /**
     * Register widget with WordPress.
     */
    public function __construct() {
        parent::__construct(
            'foo_widget', // Base ID
            'Foo_Widget', // Name
            array( 'description' => __( 'A Foo Widget', 'text_domain' ), ) // Args
        );
    }
    /**
     * Front-end display of widget.
     *
     * @see WP_Widget::widget()
     *
     * @param array $args     Widget arguments.
     * @param array $instance Saved values from database.
     */
    public function widget( $args, $instance ) {
        extract( $args );
        $title = apply_filters( 'widget_title', $instance['title'] );

        echo $before_widget;
        if ( ! empty( $title ) ) {
            echo $before_title . $title . $after_title;
        }
        echo __( 'Hello, World!', 'text_domain' );
        echo $after_widget;
    }
    /**
     * Back-end widget form.
     *
     * @see WP_Widget::form()
     *
     * @param array $instance Previously saved values from database.
     */
    public function form( $instance ) {
        if ( isset( $instance[ 'title' ] ) ) {
            $title = $instance[ 'title' ];
        }
        else {
            $title = __( 'New title', 'text_domain' );
        }
        ?>
        <p>
        <label for="<?php echo $this->get_field_name( 'title' ); ?>"><?php _e( 'Title:' ); ?></label>
        <input class="widefat" id="<?php echo $this->get_field_id( 'title' ); ?>" name="<?php echo $this->get_field_name( 'title' ); ?>" type="text" value="<?php echo esc_attr( $title ); ?>" />
        </p>
        <?php
    }
    /**
     * Sanitize widget form values as they are saved.
     *
     * @see WP_Widget::update()
     *
     * @param array $new_instance Values just sent to be saved.
     * @param array $old_instance Previously saved values from database.
     *
     * @return array Updated safe values to be saved.
     */
    public function update( $new_instance, $old_instance ) {
        $instance = array();
        $instance['title'] = ( !empty( $new_instance['title'] ) ) ? strip_tags( $new_instance['title'] ) : '';

        return $instance;
    }
} // class Foo_Widget
?>
```

This sample widget can then be registered in the widgets_init hook:

```php
<?php
// Register Foo_Widget widget
add_action( 'widgets_init', function() { register_widget( 'Foo_Widget' ); } );
?>
```

####Example with a Namespace

If you use PHP 5.3 with namespaces you should call the constructor directly as in the following example:

```php
<?php
namespace a\b\c;
class My_Widget_Class extends \WP_Widget {
    function __construct() {
            parent::__construct( 'baseID', 'name' );
        }
        // ... rest of the functions
}
?>
```

and call the register widget with:

```php
<?php add_action( 'widgets_init', function() { register_widget( 'a\b\c\My_Widget_Class' ); } ); ?>
```

See [this answer at stack exchange](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5247302/php-namespace-5-3-and-wordpress-widget/5247436#5247436) for more detail.

###Special considerations

If you want to use a widget inside another template file, rather than in a sidebar, you can use the_widget() to display it programmatically. You simply need to pass the widget name to the function like this:

```php
<?php the_widget( 'My_Widget_Class' ); ?>
```

##Navigation Menus

Navigation Menus are customizable menus in your theme. They allow users to add Pages, Posts, Categories, and URLs to the menu. To create a navigation menu you’ll need to register it, and then display the menu in the appropriate location in your theme.

###Register Menus

In your theme’s functions.php, you need to register your menu(s). This sets the name that will appear at **Appearance -> Menus**.

First of all, you will use [register_nav_menus()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_nav_menus/) to register the menu.

In this example, two locations are added to the “Manage Locations” tab: “Header Menu” and “Extra Menu”.

```php
<?php
function register_my_menu() {
  register_nav_menus(
    array(
      'header-menu' => __( 'Header Menu' ),
      'extra-menu' => __( 'Extra Menu' )
     )
   );
 }
 add_action( 'init', 'register_my_menus' );
 ?>
 ```

###Display Menus

Once you’ve registered your menus, you need to use [wp_nav_menu()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_nav_menu/) to tell your theme where to display them. For example, add the following code to your header.php file to display the header-menu that was registered above.

```php
<?php
wp_nav_menu( array( 'theme_location' => 'header-menu' ) );
?>
```

>**Note**: A full list of parameters can be found in the `wp_nav_menu()` page in the function reference

Repeat this process for any additional menus you want to display in your theme. Optionally, you can add a container class which allows you to style the menu with CSS.

```php
<?php
wp_nav_menu(
  array(
    'theme_location' => 'extra-menu',
    'container_class' => 'my_extra_menu_class' ) );
?>
```

>**Note**: A full list of CSS Classes can be found in the `wp_nav_menu()` page in the function reference. You can use these to style your menus.

##Pages, Posts, & Custom Post Types

There are many different types of content in WordPress. These content types are normally described as Post Types, which may be a little confusing since it refers to all different types of content in WordPress. A post is a specific Post Type, and so is a page.

Internally, all of the Post Types are stored in the same place — in the `wp_posts` database table — but are differentiated by a database column called `post_type`.

In addition to the default Post Types, you can also create Custom Post Types.

###Default Post Types

There are five default Post Types readily available to users or internally used by the WordPress installation:

- Post (Post Type: ‘post’)
- Page (Post Type: ‘page’)
- Attachment (Post Type: ‘attachment’)
- Revision (Post Type: ‘revision’)
- Navigation menu (Post Type: ‘nav_menu_item’)

The Post Types above can be modified and removed by a plugin or theme, but it’s not recommended that you remove built-in functionality for a widely-distributed theme or plugin. Custom or one-off installs may need more aggressive customization.

####Post

Posts are used in blogs. They are:

- displayed in reverse sequential order by time, with the newest post first
- have a date and time stamp
- may have the default taxonomies of categories and tags applied
- are used for creating feeds

####Page

Pages are a static Post Type, outside of the normal blog stream/feed. Their features are:

- non-time dependent and without a time stamp
- are not organized using the categories and/or tags taxonomies
- can have page templates applied to them
- can be organized in a hierarchical structure — i.e. pages can be parents/children of other pages

####Attachment

Attachments are commonly used to display images or media in content, and may also be used to link to relevant files. Their features are:

- contain information (such as name or description) about files uploaded through the media upload system
- for images, this includes metadata information stored in the `wp_postmeta` table (including size, thumbnails, location, etc)

####Revision

Revisions contain a draft post along with any past revisions of a published post. Revisions are basically identical to the published post they belong to, but have the post set as their parent using the `post_parent` column of the `wp_posts` table.

####Navigation Menu

Navigation Menu is a Post Type that contain information about a single item in the WordPress navigation menu system. While they are included in the `wp_posts` table, they are used for other purposes than displayable website content.

####Custom Post Types

Using Custom Post Types, you can create your own post type. It is not recommend that you place this functionality in your theme. This type of functionality should be placed/created in a plugin. This ensures the portability of your user’s content, and that if the theme is changed the content stored in the Custom Post Types won’t disappear.

##Categories, Tags, & Custom Taxonomies

Taxonomies are the method of classifying content and data in WordPress. When you use a taxonomy you’re grouping similar things together. The taxonomy refers to the sum of those groups. As with Post Types, there are a number of default taxonomies, and you can also create your own.

###Default Taxonomies

The default taxonomies in WordPress are:

- categories: a hierarchical taxonomy that organizes content in the post Post Type
- tags: a non-hierarchical taxonomy that organizes content in the post Post Type
- post formats: a method for creating formats for your posts. You can learn more about these on the Post Formats page.

####Terms

Terms are items within your taxonomy. So, for example, if you have the `Animal` taxonomy you would have the terms, dogs, cats, and sheep. Terms can be created via the WordPress admin, or you can use the [wp_insert_term()](http://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_insert_term/) function.

###Database Schema

Taxonomies and terms are stored in the following database tables:

- wp_terms – stores all of the terms
- wp_term_taxonomy – places the term in a taxonomy
- wp_term_relationships – relates the taxonomy to an object (for example, category to post)

![the wordpress taxonomy database schema](http://developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/taxonomy-schema.jpg)

>**Alert**: The development team is currently revising how taxonomies are dealt with and stored in WordPress. In a future version of WordPress, the `wp_terms` and `wp_term_taxonomy` tables will be merged. As of WordPress 4.2, shared terms will be split.

###Templates

WordPress offers several different hierarchies of templates for categories, tags, or custom taxonomies. More details on their structure and usage may be found on the Taxonomy Templates page.

###Custom Taxonomies

It is possible to create new taxonomies in WordPress. You may, for example, want to create an author taxonomy on a book review website, or an actor taxonomy on a film site. As with custom post type **it is recommended that you put this functionality in a plugin**. This ensures that when the user changes their website’s design, their content is preserved in the plugin.

##Taxonomy Templates

When a visitor clicks on a hyperlink to a taxonomy, whether that’s a category, tag, or custom taxonomy, WordPress displays a page of posts in reverse chronological order filtered by that taxonomy.

By default, this page is generated using the `index.php` template file. You can create optional template files to override and refine the `index.php` template files. This section explains how to use and create such templates.

###Taxonomy Template Hierarchy

WordPress display posts in the order determined by the Template Hierarchy.

The `category.php`, `tag.php`, and `taxonomy.php` templates allow posts **filtered** by taxonomy to be treated differently from **unfiltered** posts or posts **filtered by a different taxonomy**. (Note: post refers to any post type – posts, pages, custom post types, etc) These files let you target specific taxonomies, or specific taxonomy terms; for example:

- `taxonomy-{taxonomy}-{term}.php`
- `taxonomy-{taxonomy}.php`
- `tag-{slug}.php`
- `tag-{id}.php`
- `category-{slug}.php`
- `category-{ID}.php`

So, for example, you could format all posts in a `animal` taxonomy named `news` on a page that looks different from posts filtered in other categories.

The `archive.php` template provides the most general form of control, providing a layout for all archives; that is, a page that displays a list of posts.

####Category

For categories, WordPress looks for the `category-{slug}.php` file. If it doesn’t exist, WordPress then looks for a file for the next hierarchical level, `category-{ID}.php`, and so on. If WordPress fails to find any specialized templates or an `archive.php` template file, it will revert to the default behavior, using `index.php`.

The category hierarchy is listed below:

1. `category-{slug}.php`: For example, if the category’s slug is named “news,” WordPress would look for a file named `category-news.php`
2. `category-{ID}.php`: For example, if the category’s ID is “6”, WordPress would look for a file named `category-6.php`
3. `category.php`
4. `archive.php`
5. `index.php`

####Tag

For tags, WordPress looks for the `tag-{slug}.php` file. If it doesn’t exist, WordPress then looks for a file for the next hierarchical level, `tag-{ID}.php`, and so on. If WordPress fails to find any specialized templates or an `archive.php` template file, it will revert to the default behavior, using `index.php`.

The tag hierarchy is listed below:

1. `tag-{slug}.php`: For example, if the tag’s slug is named `sometag`, WordPress would look for a file named `tag-sometag.php`
2. `tag-{id}.php`: For example, if the tag’s ID were 6, WordPress would look for a file named `tag-6.php`
3. `tag.php`
4. `archive.php`
5. `index.php`

####Custom Taxonomy

A custom taxonomy hierarchy works similarly to the categories and tags hierarchies described above. WordPress looks for the `taxonomy-{slug}.php` file. If it doesn’t exist, WordPress then looks for a file for the next hierarchical level, `taxonomy-{ID}.php`, and so on. If WordPress fails to find any specialized templates or an `archive.php` template file, it will revert to the default behavior, using `index.php`.

The hierarchy for a custom taxonomy is listed below:

1. `taxonomy-{taxonomy}-{term}.php`: For example, if the taxonomy is named `sometax`, and the taxonomy’s term is `someterm`, WordPress would look for a file named `taxonomy-sometax-someterm.php`
2. `taxonomy-{taxonomy}.php`: For example, if the taxonomy is named `sometax`, WordPress would look for a file named `taxonomy-sometax.php`
3. `tag.php`
4. `archive.php`
5. `index.php`

###Creating Taxonomy Template Files

Now you’ve decided that you need to create custom designs for content based on taxonomies, where do you start?

Rather than starting from a blank file, it is good practice to **copy the next file in the hierarchy**, if it exists. If you’ve already created an `archive.php`, make a copy called `category.php` and modify that to suit your design needs. If you don’t have an `archive.php` file, use a copy of your theme’s `index.php` as a starting point.

Follow the same procedure if you are creating any taxonomy template file. Use a copy of your `archive.php`, `category.php`, `tag.php`, or `index.php` as a starting point.

###Examples

Now that you’ve selected the template file in your theme’s directory that you need to modify let’s look at some examples.

####Adding Text to Category Pages

#####Static Text Above Posts

Suppose you want some static text displayed before the list of posts on your category page(s). “Static” is text that remains the same, no matter which posts are displayed below, and no matter which category is displayed.

Open your file and above The Loop section of your Template file, insert the following code:

```html
<p>
This is some text that will display at the top of the Category page.
</p>
```

This text will only display on an archive page displaying posts in that category.

#####Different Text on Some Category Pages

What if you want to display different text based on the category page that the visitor is using? You could add default text to the main `category.php` file, and create special `category-{slug}.php` files each with their own version of the text, but this would create lots of files in your theme. Instead, you can use conditional tags.

Again, this code would be added before the loop:

```php
<?php if (is_category('Category A')) : ?>
      <p>This is the text to describe category A</p>
<?php elseif (is_category('Category B')) : ?>
      <p>This is the text to describe category B</p>
<?php else : ?>
      <p>This is some generic text to describe all other category pages,
I could be left blank</p>
<?php endif; ?>
```

This code does the following:

1. checks to see if the visitor has requested Category A. If it has, it displays the first piece of text.
2. if the user didn’t request category A, it checks for category B. If it is, it displays the second piece of text.
3. if neither was requested WordPress displays the default text.

#####Display Text only on First Page of Archive

If you have more posts than will fit on one page of your archive, the category will split into multiple pages. Perhaps you just want to display static text if the user is on the first page of the results.

To do this, use a PHP if statement, which looks at the value of the `$paged` WordPress variable.

Put the following above The Loop:

```php
<?php if ( $paged < 2 ) : ?>
      <p>Text for first page of Category archive.</p>
<?php else : ?>
<?php endif; ?>
```

This code asks whether the page displayed is the first page of the archive; if it is, the text for the first page is displayed. Otherwise, the text for the subsequent pages is displayed.

####Modify How Posts are Displayed

#####Excerpts vs. Full Posts

You can choose whether to display full posts or just excerpts. By displaying excerpts you shorten the length of your archive page.

Open your file and find the loop. Look for:


```php
<?php the_content() ?>
```

And replace it with:

```php
<?php the_excerpt() ?>
```

And if your theme is displaying excerpts but you want to display the full content, replace `the_excerpt` with `the_content`.
