#Getting Started

**Ready to start developing WordPress themes?** You’re in the right place.

In this chapter, we’ll take a look at what WordPress themes are and how they work. Then, we’ll discuss the GPL, the software license used for WordPress and all of the themes in the WordPress theme directory.

Next, we’ll look at some of the tools you’ll need in your WordPress theme development toolkit, including setting up a local development environment.

We’ll finish up this chapter by looking at a few solid WordPress theme examples, and then get you started building your first simple theme.


##Who Should Read This Handbook?

The Theme Developer Handbook is a self-contained resource to help you learn the basics of WordPress theme development. You should read this handbook to:

- develop a child theme meant to work with a parent theme
- create a new theme based on an existing one
- understand the inner workings of themes in general
- develop a theme based on nothing but your imagination

###Your skill level

To get the most out of this handbook, you should have:

- An understanding and some experience with web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and PHP.
- Some experience installing, setting up, and configuring websites using WordPress.

>**Note**: An understanding of how MySQL databases work, as well as server technologies in general, is helpful but not a requirement for developing WordPress themes. Likewise, while JavaScript knowledge can be useful, it is not required.

###What this handbook will cover

This handbook provides the basic information required to develop WordPress themes, including in-depth coverage of essential template tags and functions.

WordPress is a vast subject. Covering every possible tag, function, and scenario is beyond the scope of this handbook. If you need help with specific functions, you can find that information in the [Code Reference](http://developer.wordpress.org/reference).

Our purpose is to give you a solid foundation for WordPress theme development, to provide step-by-step instruction in building basic themes, and to provide tips and resources useful in furthering your skills.


##What is a Theme?

A WordPress theme changes the look, layout, and design of your website. When you change your theme, it changes how the site looks on the front-end, i.e. what a visitor sees when they browse to your site on a web. There are thousands of WordPress themes, and each one makes your website look entirely different.

###What can themes do?

Themes take the content and data stored by WordPress and display in the browser. When you create your WordPress theme you are determining how that content looks and is displayed. There are so many options available to you when building your theme. For example:

- you can create different layouts, such as static or liquid, one column or two. You can create grids or make your website response
- you can determine where in the website your content appears
- you can determine when content appears – perhaps it only appears after a certain action or on a certain device
- you can use beautiful typography that makes your content readable
- you can add different design elements using CSS
- you can make use of media, display images and videos

WordPress themes have a lot of power. But as with every web design project, a theme is more than colour and layout: **A good theme dictates how your visitors engage your website’s content**, as well as how they see it.

###What are themes made of?

At its most basic, a WordPress theme is a collection of different files that work together to create what you see, as well as how your site behaves.

####Required files

There are only **two files absolutely required in a WordPress** theme:

- `index.php` – the main template file
- `style.css` – the main style file

Though not required, you may see additional files in a theme’s folder including:

- PHP files – including **template files** and **theme functions**
- **Localization files**
- CSS files
- Graphics
- JavaScript
- Text – usually license info, readme.txt instructions, and/or a changelog file

###What is the difference between a theme and a plugin?

It is common to find cross-over between functionality found in themes and plugins. However, best practices are:

- a theme controls the presentation of content
- a plugin is used to control the behavior and functionality of your WordPress site.

**Any theme you create should not add critical functionality.** Why? When the user changes their theme they would lose access to that functionality. For example, say you build a theme with a portfolio feature: the user builds their portfolio but in the future they want to change themes. They’re unable to do so as they’re locked in to the portfolio feature that you have created.

By moving your functionality to plugins, you create an environment where the look of the site can be easily changed without rebuilding functionality.

>**Note**: Remember, some users switch themes often. It is best practice to make sure any functionality your site requires, even if the design changes, is in a separate plugin.

###Themes on WordPress.org

One of the safest places to download WordPress themes is in the [WordPress.org Themes Directory](http://wordpress.org/themes/). All themes are closely reviewed, and must meet rigorous [theme review guidelines](https://developer.wordpress.org/theme/release/theme-review-guidelines/) to ensure quality and security.

While you don’t have to release your themes to the world for download, some day you may wish to [submit a theme to WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/themes/upload/).


##WordPress Licensing & the GPL

If you plan to develop WordPress themes for the public—either free or paid— you need to get acquainted with WordPress’ license, the GNU General Public License (commonly called the GPL).

###GPL basic freedoms

One key reason the spirit of openness and sharing has thrived within the WordPress community is because of the fundamental principles that form the core of its license. A good way to think of the GPL is as a “bill of rights” for software. The GPL establishes the following four freedoms:

1. The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.
2. The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.
3. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
4. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions, giving the community a chance to benefit from your changes.

###What is “free” in the context of software?

The “free” in free software, refers to freedom, not to price. The free software foundation likes to say “free as in speech, not as in beer.” Free software is software that users are free to do what they wish with. It does not need to be free from cost (although the ones that are hosted on the WordPress.org theme directory are).

Free software can come with a price tag – in other words, you can create a GPL theme and sell it for $50 and it would still be free software. Why is this? Because the user is free to run, modify, and distribute the software or any modifications of that software.

###Keeping it free for all

The freedoms of the GPL don’t just apply to the original piece of software; works derived from GPL-licensed software must also adopt the same license, without restrictions or additional terms.

In this sense, the GPL provides the ultimate protection of freedom by making sure that anything that is derived from free software cannot be “locked down”after the fact; it must remain forever free to future experimentation and exploration.

###Do I need to license my themes under the GPL?

If you have no plans to distribute your theme then you do not need to adopt the GPL license for your work. The GPL only applies to distributed software. If you are not distributing your software – for example, a theme used only by yourself or on your local machine – you do not need to adopt the GPL.

If you wish to submit your creation to the free theme repository on WordPress.org, it must be 100% GPL compliant, including CSS and image files. Because the freedoms spelled out in the GPL are at the very heart of WordPress, we encourage developers to distribute their themes with a 100% GPL-compatible license.

>**Note**: Freedom is an important part of developing WordPress themes. **If you plan to distribute your theme, it is a good idea to license it fully under the GPL**, so others can enjoy the same freedoms that you did when creating it.

##Setting up a Development Environment

###Why set up a development environment?

A development environment is a set of software that lets you write code for a specific platform. If you’re developing for any platform, you should have an environment suited to that platform.  Setting up a local environment for WordPress theme development is crucial for several reasons:

- you can build your theme locally without having to rely on a remote server. This will speed up your development process and you can see changes instantly in your browser.
- you do not need an internet connection to build your theme.
- you can test your theme from a variety of perspectives. This is important, especially if you plan on releasing your theme to a larger audience and want to ensure maximum compatibility.

###Your WordPress local development environment

For developing WordPress themes, you need to set up a development environment suited to WordPress. There are a number of options, including:

- a LAMP stack (Linux Apache MySql PHP). This is a local server (much like the server that runs on your web server). You can install pre-bundled programs that contain all of these, like XAMPP or MAMP.
- more recently, developers are using Vagrant to create easily reproducible development environments. A popular option is [Varying Vagrant Vagrants (VVV)](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV) which creates a WordPress development environment.

You can find a list of tutorials for setting up development environments at the bottom of the page.

You will also need a text editor to write your code in. Your choice of text editor will be down to your personal taste, but remember that learning a good text editor can speed up your development process. Your text editor can be everything from a basic tool for writing code to a fully integrated development environment (IDE) with tools for debugging and testings. It’s worth doing some research as some even include support for WordPress development.

###Supporting older versions of WordPress

It’s standard practice for WordPress themes to support at least two versions back to ensure a minimum of backward compatibility. For example, if the current version of WordPress is at 4.0, then you should also make sure that your theme works well in versions 3.9 and 3.8 as well.

You can refer to the WordPress Roadmap page to access older versions of WordPress. Then you can download and install older WordPress versions, creating multiple development sites, each running different WordPress versions for testing.

###WP_DEBUG

The [WP_DEBUG](http://codex.wordpress.org/WP_DEBUG) PHP constant is used to trigger the built-in “debug” mode on your WordPress installation. This let you see where errors in your theme are. To enable it:

1. Open your WordPress installation’s `wp-config.php` file

2. Change `define( 'WP_DEBUG', false );` to `define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );`

>**Note**: While normally set to `false` in the `wp-config.php` file, in development copies of WordPress—alpha and beta versions of the upcoming release—`WP_DEBUG` is already set to `true` by default.

###Other WordPress Development Tools

In addition to `WP_DEBUG`, the following plugins and unit test data sets are an important part of your [development toolset](http://nacin.com/2010/04/23/5-ways-to-debug-wordpress/) and will help you develop better WordPress themes.

>**Note**: We don’t recommended using these debug tools on live sites; they are meant for local testing and staging installs.

- [WordPress.org Theme Unit Test Data](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test) – an XML file containing dummy test data you can upload to test how themes perform with different types and layouts of content.
- [WordPress.com Theme Unit Test Data](http://themetest.wordpress.com/) – dummy test data you can upload to a WordPress installation to test your theme, including WordPress.com-specific features.
- [Developer (WordPress Plugin)](http://wordpress.org/plugins/developer/) – helps optimize your development environment by allowing easy installation of tools and plugins that help in troubleshooting and ensuring code quality.
- [Theme-Check (WordPress Plugin)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/) – A simple and easy way to test your theme for compliance with the latest WordPress standards and practices.

###WordPress Theme Review Guidelines

In addition to the above development tools, it’s a good idea to stay up-to-date on the WordPress.org Theme Review Team’s [Guidelines](http://make.wordpress.org/themes/guidelines/) for theme submission. These guidelines are the “gold standard” for quality theme development and are useful even if you don’t plan on releasing a theme through WordPress.org.

##Theme Development Examples

One of the best ways to understand theme coding standards is to find examples of others themes that have been written with these standards in mind.

###Default “Twenty” themes

Packaged in every version of WordPress since version 3.0 (and named after the year they were released in), the default themes are some of the best places to study how other themes are built. This is because they are designed with broad use in mind and fully adhere to WordPress coding standards. You can download and study their theme files, and keep them around as examples you can refer to while learning how to develop your own themes:


- [Twenty Fourteen](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-content/themes/twentyfourteen)
- [Twenty Thirteen](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-content/themes/twentythirteen)
- [Twenty Twelve](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-content/themes/twentytwelve)
- [Twenty Eleven](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-content/themes/twentyeleven)
- [Twenty Ten](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-content/themes/twentyten)

###The Underscores theme

Unlike the default “Twenties” themes, the _s (or [Underscores](https://github.com/Automattic/_s/)) theme is aimed at developers rather than end-users. It is intended to be a starter theme which you can use as a base to speed your development. It has a number of features:

- Well-comment HTML5 templates, including error templates.
- Sample custom templates like a custom header implementation.
- Custom template tags to keep templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.
- A number of scripts to improve keyboard navigation as well as small screen navigation.
- Sample CSS layouts.
- Starter CSS on which to build your design.
- GPL-licensed code.

The features above make Underscores a great theme for a developer wanting to create their own theme. If you remove the extras, the base that’s left is a good example of a well-coded theme, developed with standards and best-practices in mind.

A more detailed overview is available on [Underscores’ website](http://underscores.me/).

###Other Sources

Additionally, all themes published in the theme directory are reviewed for standards prior to being published. [Reviewing themes](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/) in the directory is a great way to better understand how theme development works and is a good way to get inspiration for your own theme.


##Your First Theme

###Required Files

As mentioned earlier in the “What is a Theme” section, the only files needed for a WordPress theme to work out of the box are an index.php file to display your list of posts and a `style.css` file to style the content.

Once you get into more advanced development territory and your themes grow in size and complexity, you’ll find it easier to break your theme into many separate files (called template files) instead. For example, most WordPress themes will also include:

- header.php
- index.php
- sidebar.php
- footer.php

We will cover creating separate files later in this handbook, but for now let’s get your first theme launched!

>**Note**: The following steps assume you have already completed the “Setting up a Development Environment” section.

###Step 1 – Create a theme folder

First, create a new folder on your computer, and name it my-first-theme. This is where all of your theme’s files will go.


###Step 2 – Create a style.css file

You can use any basic text editor on your computer to create a new file called `style.css`.

If you’re on a Windows-based machine use Notepad for now and if you’re using a Mac then use TextEdit.

Copy and paste the following code into your newly created `style.css` file:

```css
/*
Theme Name: My First WordPress Theme
*/

body {
    background: #21759b;
}
```

###Step 3 – Create an index.php file

Now create a file named index.php and put it into your theme’s folder, adding the following code to it:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="<?php bloginfo( 'charset' ); ?>">
    <title><?php wp_title( '|', true, 'right' ); ?></title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="<?php echo esc_url( get_stylesheet_uri() ); ?>" type="text/css" />
    <?php wp_head(); ?>
</head>
<body>
    <h1><?php bloginfo( 'name' ); ?></h1>
    <h2><?php bloginfo( 'description' ); ?></h2>

    <?php if ( have_posts() ) : while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>

        <h3><?php the_title(); ?></h3>

        <?php the_content(); ?>
        <?php wp_link_pages(); ?>
        <?php edit_post_link(); ?>

        <?php endwhile; ?>

        <?php
        if ( get_next_posts_link() ) {
            next_posts_link();
        }
        ?>
        <?php
        if ( get_previous_posts_link() ) {
            previous_posts_link();
        }
        ?>

    <?php else: ?>

    <p>No posts found. :(</p>

    <?php endif; ?>
    <?php wp_footer(); ?>
</body>
</html>
```

###Step 4 – Install Your Theme

Copy your new theme into the `wp-content/themes` folder on your development environment and activate it for review and testing.

###Step 5 – Activate Your Theme

Now that you’ve installed your theme, go to `Admin > Appearance > Themes` to activate it.
![getting-started-your-first-theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/07/getting-started-your-first-theme-02.png)

###Using Your First Theme

Congratulations – you’ve just made your first WordPress theme!

If you activate your new theme and view it within a browser, you should see something like this:

![Here’s how Your First Theme looks on the front end.](https://developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/07/getting-started-your-first-theme-03.png)

Okay, so it’s not the prettiest theme yet, but it’s a terrific start!

###What have we learned?

Although your first theme may be missing the functionality and design elements that are found in other themes, the basic building blocks of a WordPress theme, as we have just created above, are all the same.

Remember that the key here is not to get caught up in how all those other things are done now, but to understand the guiding principles behind making WordPress themes that will stand the test of time, no matter how the code changes or the template file structure changes over time.

All websites, regardless of how they are created underneath the hood, need common elements: headers, primary content areas, menus, sidebars, footers, and the like. You’ll find that making WordPress themes is really just another way of crafting a website.

From this most basic theme, you’ll start learning about the building blocks that you put together to create a more complex theme.
