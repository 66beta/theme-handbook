#Categories, Tags, & Custom Taxonomies (In Progress)

Taxonomies are the method of classifying content and data in WordPress. When you use a taxonomy you’re grouping similar things together. The taxonomy refers to the sum of those groups. As with Post Types, there are a number of default taxonomies, and you can also create your own.

##Default Taxonomies

The default taxonomies in WordPress are:

- categories: a hierarchical taxonomy that organizes content in the post Post Type
- tags: a non-hierarchical taxonomy that organizes content in the post Post Type
- post formats: a method for creating formats for your posts. You can learn more about these on the Post Formats page.

###Terms

Terms are items within your taxonomy. So, for example, if you have the `Animal` taxonomy you would have the terms, dogs, cats, and sheep. Terms can be created via the WordPress admin, or you can use the [wp_insert_term()](http://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_insert_term/) function.

##Database Schema

Taxonomies and terms are stored in the following database tables:

- `wp_terms` – stores all of the terms
- `wp_term_taxonomy` – places the term in a taxonomy
- `wp_term_relationships` – relates the taxonomy to an object (for example, category to post)

>**Alert**: The development team is currently revising how taxonomies are dealt with and stored in WordPress. In a future version of WordPress, the `wp_terms` and `wp_term_taxonomy` tables will be merged. As of WordPress 4.2, shared terms will be split.

##Templates

WordPress offers several different hierarchies of templates for categories, tags, or custom taxonomies. More details on their structure and usage may be found on the Taxonomy Templates page.

##Custom Taxonomies

It is possible to create new taxonomies in WordPress. You may, for example, want to create an author taxonomy on a book review website, or an actor taxonomy on a film site. As with custom post type **it is recommended that you put this functionality in a plugin**. This ensures that when the user changes their website’s design, their content is preserved in the plugin.
