#Plugin API Hooks (In Progress)

A themes should work well with WordPress plugins. Plugins add their functionality by using action and filters, collectively called hooks (see [Plugin API](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API) for more information).

Most hooks are executed internally by WordPress, so your Theme does not need special tags for them to work. However, a few hooks need to be included in your theme templates. These hooks are fired by special Template Tags:

[wp_head()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_head/) Goes at the end of the <head> element of a theme’s header.php template file.
[wp_footer()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_footer/) Goes in footer.php, just before the closing </body> tag.
[wp_meta()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_meta/) Typically goes in the <li>Meta</li> section of a Theme’s menu or sidebar.
[comment_form()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/comment_form/) Goes in comments.php directly before the file’s closing tag (</div>).

Take a look at a core theme’s templates for examples of how these hooks are used.
