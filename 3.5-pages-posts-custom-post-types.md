#Pages, Posts, & Custom Post Types (In Progress)

There are many different types of content in WordPress. These content types are normally described as Post Types, which may be a little confusing since it refers to all different types of content in WordPress. A post is a specific Post Type, and so is a page.

Internally, all of the Post Types are stored in the same place — in the `wp_posts` database table — but are differentiated by a database column called `post_type`.

In addition to the default Post Types, you can also create Custom Post Types.

##Default Post Types

There are five default Post Types readily available to users or internally used by the WordPress installation:

- Post (Post Type: ‘post’)
- Page (Post Type: ‘page’)
- Attachment (Post Type: ‘attachment’)
- Revision (Post Type: ‘revision’)
- Navigation menu (Post Type: ‘nav_menu_item’)

The Post Types above can be modified and removed by a plugin or theme, but it’s not recommended that you remove built-in functionality for a widely-distributed theme or plugin. Custom or one-off installs may need more aggressive customization.

###Post

Posts are used in blogs. They are:

- displayed in reverse sequential order by time, with the newest post first
- have a date and time stamp
- may have the default taxonomies of categories and tags applied
- are used for creating feeds

###Page

Pages are a static Post Type, outside of the normal blog stream/feed. Their features are:

- non-time dependent and without a time stamp
- are not organized using the categories and/or tags taxonomies
- can have page templates applied to them
- can be organized in a hierarchical structure — i.e. pages can be parents/children of other pages

###Attachment

Attachments are commonly used to display images or media in content, and may also be used to link to relevant files. Their features are:

- contain information (such as name or description) about files uploaded through the media upload system
- for images, this includes metadata information stored in the `wp_postmeta` table (including size, thumbnails, location, etc)

###Revision

Revisions contain a draft post along with any past revisions of a published post. Revisions are basically identical to the published post they belong to, but have the post set as their parent using the `post_parent` column of the `wp_posts` table.

###Navigation Menu

Navigation Menu is a Post Type that contain information about a single item in the WordPress navigation menu system. While they are included in the `wp_posts` table, they are used for other purposes than displayable website content.

###Custom Post Types

Using Custom Post Types, you can create your own post type. It is not recommend that you place this functionality in your theme. This type of functionality should be placed/created in a plugin. This ensures the portability of your user’s content, and that if the theme is changed the content stored in the Custom Post Types won’t disappear.
