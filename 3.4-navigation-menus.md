#Navigation Menus (In Progress)

Navigation Menus are customizable menus in your theme. They allow users to add Pages, Posts, Categories, and URLs to the menu. To create a navigation menu you’ll need to register it, and then display the menu in the appropriate location in your theme.

##Register Menus

In your theme’s functions.php, you need to register your menu(s). This sets the name that will appear at **Appearance -> Menus**.

First of all, you will use [register_nav_menus()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_nav_menus/) to register the menu.

In this example, two locations are added to the “Manage Locations” tab: “Header Menu” and “Extra Menu”.

```php
<?php
function register_my_menu() {
  register_nav_menus(
    array(
      'header-menu' => __( 'Header Menu' ),
      'extra-menu' => __( 'Extra Menu' )
     )
   );
 }
 add_action( 'init', 'register_my_menus' );
 ?>
 ```

##Display Menus

Once you’ve registered your menus, you need to use [wp_nav_menu()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_nav_menu/) to tell your theme where to display them. For example, add the following code to your header.php file to display the header-menu that was registered above.

```php
<?php
wp_nav_menu( array( 'theme_location' => 'header-menu' ) );
?>
```

>**Note**: A full list of parameters can be found in the `wp_nav_menu()` page in the function reference

Repeat this process for any additional menus you want to display in your theme. Optionally, you can add a container class which allows you to style the menu with CSS.

```php
<?php
wp_nav_menu(
  array(
    'theme_location' => 'extra-menu',
    'container_class' => 'my_extra_menu_class' ) );
?>
```

>**Note**: A full list of CSS Classes can be found in the `wp_nav_menu()` page in the function reference. You can use these to style your menus.
