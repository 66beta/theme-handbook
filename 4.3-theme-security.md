#Theme Security (In Progress)

The WordPress development team takes security seriously. With so much of the web relying on the integrity of the platform, security is a necessity. While the core developers have a dedicated team focused on securing the core platform, as a theme developer you are quite aware that there is potentially much that is outside the core which can be vulnerable. Because WordPress provides so much power and flexibility, plugins and themes are key points of weakness.

This chapter will provide some background to the biggest potential security holes, and how you can harden your theme against them.

##Types of Vulnerabilities

###SQL injection

SQL injection happens when values being inputed are not properly sanitized allowing for any SQL commands in the inputed data to potentially be executed. To prevent this, the WordPress API is extensive, offering functions like `add_post_meta();` instead of you needing to adding the post meta manually via SQL `(INSERT INTO wp_postmeta…)`.

The first rule for hardening your theme against SQL injection is: When there’s a WordPress function, use it.

But sometimes you need to do complex queries, that have not been accounted for in the API. If this is the case, always use the `$wpdb` functions. These were built specifically to protect your database.

###Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) happens when a nefarious party injects JavaScript into a web page.

Avoid XSS vulnerabilities by escaping output, stripping out unwanted data. As a theme’s primary responsibility is outputting content, a theme should escape dynamic content with the proper function depending on the type of the content.

###Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Cross-site request forgery, or CSRF (pronounced sea-surf) is when a nefarious party tricks a user into performing an unwanted action within a web application they are authenticated in. For example, a phishing email might contain a link to a page that would delete a user’s account in the WordPress admin.

If your theme includes any HTML or HTTP-based form submissions, use a nonce to guarantee a user intends to perform an action.
