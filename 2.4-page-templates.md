#Page Templates

Page templates are a specific type of template file that can be applied to a specific page or groups of pages.

Since a page template is a specific type of template file, here are some distinguishing features of page templates:

- Page templates only apply to pages, not to any other content type (like posts and custom post types).
- Page templates are used to change the look and feel of a page.
- A page template can be applied to a single page, a page section, or a class of pages.
- Page templates generally have a high level of specificity, targeting an individual page or group of pages. For example, a page template named `page-about.php` is more specific than the template files `page.php` or `index.php` as it will only affect a page with the slug of `about`.
- If a page template has a template name, WordPress users editing the page have control over what template will be used to render the page.

##Uses for Page Templates

Page templates display your site’s dynamic content on a page, e.g., posts, news updates, calendar events, media files, etc. You may decide that you want your homepage to look a specific way, that is quite different to other parts of your site. Or, you may want to display a featured image that links to a post on one part of the page, have a list of latest posts elsewhere, and use a custom navigation. You can use page templates to achieve these things.

This section shows you how to build page templates that can be selected by your users through their admin screens.

For example, you can build page templates for:

- full-width, one-column
- two-column with a sidebar on the right
- two-column with a sidebar on the left
- three-column

##Page Templates within the Template Hierarchy

When a person browses to your website, WordPress selects which template to use for rendering that page. As we learned earlier in the Template Hierarchy, WordPress looks for template files in the following order:

1. **Page Template** — If the page has a custom template assigned, WordPress looks for that file and, if found, uses it.
2. **page-{slug}.php** — If no custom template has been assigned, WordPress looks for and uses a specialized template that contains the page’s slug.
3. **page-{id}.php** — If a specialized template that includes the page’s slug is not found, WordPress looks for and uses a specialized template named with the page’s ID.
4. **page.php** — If a specialized template that includes the page’s ID is not found, WordPress looks for and uses the theme’s default page template.
5. **index.php** — If no specific page templates are assigned or found, WordPress defaults back to using the theme’s index file to render pages.

>**Alert**: There is also a WordPress-defined template named `paged.php`. It is not used for the page post-type but rather for displaying multiple pages of archives.

##Page Templates Purpose & User Control

If you plan on making a custom page template for your theme, you should decide a couple of things before proceeding:

- Whether the page template will be for one specific page or for any page; and
- What type of user control you want available for the template.

Every page template that has a template name can be selected by a user when they create or edit a page. The list of available templates can be found at **Pages > Add New > Attributes > Template**. Therefore, a WordPress user can choose any page template with a template name, which might not be your intention.

For example, if you want to have a specific template for your “About” page, it might not be appropriate to name that page template “About Template” as it would be globally available to all pages (i.e. the user could apply it to any page). Instead, create a single use template and WordPress will render the page with the appropriate template, whenever a user visits the “About” page.

Conversely, many themes include the ability to choose how many columns a page will have. Each of these options is a page template that is available globally. To give your WordPress users this global option, you will need to create page templates for each option and give each a template name.

Dictating whether a template is for global use vs. singular use is achieved by the way the file is named and whether or not is has a specific comment.

>**Note**: Sometimes it is appropriate to have a template globally available even if it appears to be a single use case. When you’re creating themes for release, it can be hard to predict what a user will name their pages. Portfolio pages are a great example as not every WordPress user will name their portfolio the same thing or have the same page ID and yet they may want to use that template.

##File Organization of Page Templates

As discussed in Theme Files Organization WordPress recognizes the subfolder `page-templates`. Therefore, it’s a good idea to store your global page templates in this folder to help keep them organized.

>**Alert**: A specialized page template file (those created for only one time use) cannot be in a sub-folder, nor, if using a Child Theme, in the Parent Theme’s folder.

##Creating Custom Page Templates for Global Use

Sometimes you’ll want a template that can be used globally by any page, or by multiple pages.  Some developers will group their templates with a filename prefix, such as `page_two-columns.php`

>**Alert**:  Important! Do not use `page-` as a prefix, as WordPress will interpret the file as a specialized template, meant to apply to only one page on your site.

>**Tip**: A quick, safe method for creating a new page template is to make a copy of `page.php` and give the new file a distinct filename. That way, you start off with the HTML structure of your other pages and you can edit the new file as needed.

To create a global template, write an opening PHP comment at the top of the file that states the template’s name.

```php
<?php /* Template Name: Example Template */ ?>
```

It’s a good idea to choose a name that describes what the template does as the name is visible to WordPress users when they are editing the page. For example, you could name your template Homepage, Blog, or Portfolio.

This example from the TwentyFourteen theme creates a page template called Full Width Page:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Template Name: Full Width Page
 *
 * @package WordPress
 * @subpackage Twenty_Fourteen
 * @since Twenty Fourteen 1.0
 */
?>
```

Once you upload the file to your theme’s folder (e.g., page-templates), go to the **Page > Edit** screen in your admin dashboard.

On the right hand side under **attributes** you’ll see **template**.  This is where users are able to access your global page templates.

>**Tip**: The select list has a maximum width of 250px, so longer names may be cut off.

##Creating a Custom Page Template for One Specific Page

As mentioned in the Template Hierarchy page, you can create a template for a specific page.  To create a template for one specific page, copy your existing `page.php` file and rename it with your page’s slug or ID:

1. `page-{slug}.php`
2. `page-{ID}.php`

For example: Your About page has a slug of `about` and an ID of 6. If your active theme’s folder has a file named `page-about.php` or `page-6.php`, then WordPress will automatically find and use that file to render the About page.

To be used, specialized page templates must be in your theme’s folder (i.e. `/wp-content/themes/my-theme-name/` ).

##Using Conditional Tags in Page Templates

You can make smaller, page-specific changes with Conditional Tags in your theme’s page.php file. For instance, the below example code loads the file `header-home.php` for your front page, but loads another file (`header-about.php`) for your About page, and then applies the default `header.php` for all other pages.

```php
<?php
if ( is_front_page() ) :
    get_header( 'home' );
elseif ( is_page( 'About' ) ) :
    get_header( 'about' );
else:
    get_header();
endif;
?>
```

##Identifying a Page Template

If your template uses the [body_class()](http://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/body_class/) function, WordPress will print classes in the body tag for the post type class name (`page`), the page’s ID (`page-id-{ID}`), and the page template used. For the default `page.php`, the class name generated is `page-template-default`:

```html
<body class="page page-id-6 page-template-default">
```

>**Note**: A specialized template (page-{slug}.php or page-{ID}.php) also gets the page-template-default class rather than its own body class.

When using a custom page template, the class `page-template` will print, along with a class naming the specific template. For example, if your custom page template file is named as follows:

```php
<?php /* Template Name: My Custom Page */ ?>
```

Then then rendered HTML generated will be as follows:

```html
<body class="page page-id-6 page-template page-template-my-custom-page-php">
```

Notice the `page-template-my-custom-page-php` class that is applied to the body tag.

##Page Template Functions

These built-in WordPress functions and methods can help you work with page templates:

- [get_page_template()](http://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_page_template/) returns the path of the page template used to render the page.
- w[p_get_theme()->get_page_templates()](http://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_theme/get_page_templates/) returns all custom page templates available to the currently active theme (`get_page_templates()` is a method of the [WP_Theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_theme/) class).
- [is_page_template()](http://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/is_page_template/) returns true or false depending on whether a custom page template was used to render the page.
- [get_page_template_slug()](http://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_page_template_slug/) returns the value of custom field `_wp_page_template` (null when the value is empty or “default”).If a page has been assigned a custom template, the filename of that template is stored as the value of a custom field named `_wp_page_template` (in the `wp_postmeta` database table). (Custom fields starting with an underscore do not display in the edit screen’s custom fields module.)
