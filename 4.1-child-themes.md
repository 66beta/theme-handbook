#Child Themes (In Progress)

A child theme allows you to change small aspects of your site’s appearance yet still preserve your theme’s look and functionality. To understand how child themes work it is first important to understand the relationship between parent and child themes.

##What is a Parent Theme?

A parent theme is a complete theme which includes all of the required WordPress template files and assets for the theme to work. All themes – excluding child themes – are considered parent themes.

##What is a Child Theme?

As indicated in the overview, a child theme inherits the look and feel of the parent theme and all of its functions, but can be used to make modifications to any part of the theme. In this way, customizations are kept  separate from the parent theme’s files. Using a child theme lets you upgrade the parent theme without affecting the customizations you’ve made to your site.

Child themes:

- make your modifications portable and replicable;
- keep customization separate from parent theme functions;
- allow parent themes to be updated without destroying your modifications;
- allow you to take advantage of the effort and testing put into parent theme;
- save on development time since you are not recreating the wheel; and
- are a great way to start learning about theme development.

>**Note**: If you are making extensive customizations – beyond styles and a few theme files – creating a parent theme might be a better option than a child theme. Creating a parent theme allows you to avoid issues with deprecated code in the future. This needs to be decided on a case-by-case basis.

##How to Create a Child Theme

###1. Create a child theme folder

First, create a new folder in your themes directory, located at `wp-content/themes`.

The directory needs a name. It’s best practice to give a child theme the same name as the parent, but with `-child` appended to the end. For example, if you were making a child theme of `twentyfifteen`, then the directory would be named `twentyfifteen-child`.

###2. Create a stylesheet: style.css #

Next, you’ll need to create a stylesheet file named `style.css`, which will contain all of the CSS rules and declarations that control the look of your theme. Your stylesheet must contain the below required header comment at the very top of the file. This tells WordPress basic info about the theme, including the fact that it is a child theme with a particular parent.

```php
<?php
/*
Theme Name:     Twenty Thirteen Child
Theme URI:      http://example.com/
Description:    Child theme for the Twenty Thirteen theme
Author:         Your name here
Author URI:     http://example.com/about/
Template:       twentythirteen
Version:        0.1.0
*/
?>
```

The following information is required:

- **Theme Name** – needs to be unique to your theme
- **Template** –  the name of the parent theme directory

Add remaining information as applicable.

###3. Create a functions.php file

Most files in your child theme overwrite the parent theme’s file. That is, your `style.css` file overwrites the parent theme’s `style.css` file. However, the `functions.php` file in your child theme is different: instead of overwriting the parent theme’s `functions.php` file, it is **loaded in addition to it**. Specifically, your child theme’s `functions.php` file is loaded right before the parent theme’s `functions.php` file.

Creating a `functions.php` file is optional. It is only needed if you intend to add additional PHP code to your theme. Alternatively, PHP code may be put into a plugin, which will make the functions portable regardless of the theme you are using.

###4. Inherit styles

Unless you intend to completely change the style of your theme, it’s recommend that you inherit all of the rules of the parent theme’s `style.css` file. Inheriting the parent theme’s styles cuts down on development time if you’re only intending to make minor visual changes. Not inheriting the parent theme’s styles will allow you to use the template markup in the parent theme’s templates while rewriting the CSS from the ground-up.

In most cases, you will want to inherit the parent’s CSS. Import the parent theme’s `style.css` inside the child theme’s `style.css`:

```php
<?php @import url ("../twentythirteen/style.css"); ?>
```

###5. Add Template Files

Other than the functions.php file (as noted above), **any file you add to your child theme will overwrite the same file in the parent theme**.

In most cases, it’s best to create a copy of the template files you want to change from the parent theme, then make your modifications to the copied files, leaving the parent files unchanged. For example, if you wanted to change the code of the parent theme’s `header.php` file, you would copy the file to your child theme folder and customize it there.

You can also include files in the child theme that are not included in the parent theme. For instance, you might want to create a more specific template than is found in your parent theme, such as a template for a specific page or category archive (e.g. `page-3.php` would load for a Page with the ID of 3).

###6. Including Other Files

When you need to include files that reside within your child theme’s directory structure, you will need to use [get_stylesheet_directory()](http://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_stylesheet_directory/). Since the `style.css` is in the root of your child theme’s subdirectory, `get_stylesheet_directory()` points to your child theme’s directory (not the parent theme’s directory). To reference the parent theme directory, you would use `get_template_directory()` instead.

Below is an example illustrating how to use `get_stylesheet_directory()` when referencing a file stored within the child theme directory:

```php
<?php require_once( get_stylesheet_directory(). '/my_included_file.php' ); ?>
```

Meanwhile, this example uses `get_stylesheet_directory_uri()` to display  an image that is stored within the `/images` folder in the child theme directory.

```php
<img src="<?php echo get_stylesheet_directory_uri(); ?>/images/my_picture.png" alt="" />
```

Unlike `get_stylesheet_directory()`, which returns a file path, `get_stylesheet_directory_uri()` returns a URL, which is useful for front-end assets.

###7. Enqueueing Styles and Scripts

Scripts and styles should each be enqueued with their own function, and then those should be wrapped in an action.

WordPress won’t automatically load the stylesheet for your child theme on the front-end. Below is an example of using the [wp_enqueue_scripts()](http://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_scripts/) action hook to call a function that enqueues the child theme’s stylesheet.

```php
<?php
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'my_plugin_add_stylesheet' );
function my_plugin_add_stylesheet() {
    wp_enqueue_style( 'my-style', get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/style.css', false, '1.0', 'all' );
}
?>
```

##Special Considerations

###Post Formats

A child theme inherits post formats as defined by the parent theme. But when creating child themes, be aware that using [add_theme_support('post-formats')](http://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_theme_support/) will override the formats as defined by the parent theme, not add to it.

###RTL Support

To support RTL languages, add a rtl.css file to your child theme’s folder and then import the file into your child theme’s style.css file, using the import statement under the header comment as demonstrated below. Even if the parent theme does not have an rtl.css file, it’s recommended to add the rtl.css file to your child theme. WordPress will auto-load the rtl.css file only if is_rtl() is true.

```php
<?php
/*
Theme Name: Twenty Fifteen Child
Template: twentyfifteen
*/
@import url('../twentyfifteen/rtl.css');
?>
```

###Internationalization

Child themes can be prepared for translation into other languages by using the WordPress Internationalization API. There are special considerations regarding internationalization of child themes.

Start by adding a languages directory, for example: `twentyfifteen-child/languages/`

Next, a textdomain needs to be loaded. `load_child_theme_textdomain()` can be used in `functions.php` during the `after_setup_theme()` action. The following should illustrate:

```php
<?php
/**
  * Set up My Child Theme's textdomain.
  *
  * Declare textdomain for this child theme.
  * Translations can be added to the /languages/ directory.
  */
function twentyfifteenchild_theme_setup() {
    load_child_theme_textdomain( 'twentyfifteenchild', get_stylesheet_directory() . '/languages' );
}
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'twentyfifteenchild_theme_setup' );
?>
```

At this point, strings in the child theme are ready for translation. To ensure they are properly internationalized for translation, each string needs to have the `twentyfifteenchild` textdomain. Here is an example of echoing the phrase “Code is Poetry”:

```php
<?php _e( 'Code is Poetry', 'twentyfifteenchild' ); ?>
```

The text domain defined in [load_child_theme_textdomain()](http://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/load_child_theme_textdomain/) should be used to translate all strings in the child theme. In the event that a template file from the parent them has been included, the textdomain should be changed from the one defined in the parent theme to the one defined by the child theme.
