#Sidebars

A sidebar is any widgetized area of your theme. Widget areas are places in your theme where users can add their own widgets. Widget areas are called sidebars because they were first introduced as right or left-hand sidebar on a blog. However, there are no limitations on where a sidebar can be and theme developers create sidebars in many different places on a website. You may, for example, wish to populate the content of your theme’s homepage using widgets instead of static content or a loop.

##Registering a Sidebar

Registering a sidebar tells WordPress that you’re creating a new widget area in **Appearance > Widgets** that users can drag their widgets to. There are two functions for registering sidebars:

- [register_sidebar()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_sidebar/)
- [register_sidebars()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_sidebars/)

The first lets you register one sidebar, with the second you can register multiple sidebars.

It is recommended that you register sidebars individually as it allows you to give unique and descriptive names to each sidebar.

For example, if you have widget areas in your header and footer, it makes sense to name them “Header Widget Area” and “Footer Widget Area”, rather than “Sidebar 1″ and “Sidebar 2″(which is the default). This gives the user a useful description of the sidebar, telling them where the sidebar is located on the page.

The following code, added to `functions.php` registers a sidebar:

```php
<?php
add_action( 'widgets_init', 'my_register_sidebars' );
function my_register_sidebars() {
        /* Register the 'primary' sidebar. */
    register_sidebar(
        array(
            'id' => 'primary',
            'name' => __( 'Primary Sidebar' ),
            'description' =>; __( 'A short description of the sidebar.' ),
            'before_widget' => '<div id="%1$s" class="widget %2$s)- [',
            'after_widget' => '</div>',
            'before_title' => '<h3 class="widget-title)- [',
            'after_title' => '</h3>',
        )
    );
    /* Repeat register_sidebar() code for additional sidebars. */
}
?>
```

The code does the following:

- `register_sidebar` – tells WordPress that you’re registering a sidebar
- `'name' => __( 'Primary Widget Area', 'mytheme' )` – is the widget area’s name that will appear in **Appearance > Widgets**
- `'id' => 'sidebar-1'` – assigns an ID to the sidebar. WordPress uses this to assign widgets to a specific sidebar
- `before_widget/after_widget` – a wrapper element for widgets assigned to the sidebar. The `%1$s` and `%2$s` should always be left in `id` and `class` respectively so that plugins can make use of them. By default, WordPress sets these as list items but in the above example they have been altered to div
- `before_title/after_title` – the wrapper elements for the widget’s title. By default, WordPress sets it to `h2` but using `h3` makes it more semantic.

##Displaying Sidebars in your Theme

Now that your sidebars are registered, you will want to display them in your theme. To do this, there are two steps:

1. Create the `sidebar.php` template file and display the sidebar using the [dynamic_sidebar](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/dynamic_sidebar/) function
2. Load in your theme using the [get_sidebar](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_sidebar/) function

###Create a Sidebar Template File

A sidebar template contains all of the code for your sidebar. WordPress recognizes the file sidebar.php and any template file with the name `sidebar-{name}.php`. This means that you can organize your files with each sidebar in its own template file.

For the above example, you should follow the above process for creating your sidebar file:

1. Create `sidebar-primary.php`
2. Add the following code:

```php
<div id="sidebar-primary" class="sidebar)- [
    <?php dynamic_sidebar( 'primary' ); ?>
</div>
```

>**Note**: that `dynamic_sidebar` takes a single parameter of `$index`, which can be either the sidebar’s `name` or `id`.

###Load your Sidebar

To load your sidebar in your theme, use the `get_sidebar` function. This should be inserted into the template file where you want the sidebar to display. To load the default `sidebar.php` use the following:

```php
<?php get_sidebar(); ?>
```

To display the Primary sidebar (per the above example), pass the `$name` parameter to the function:

```php
<?php get_sidebar( 'primary' ); ?>

```

##Customizing your Sidebar

There are lots of ways that you can customize your sidebars. Here are some examples:

###Display Default Sidebar Content

You may wish to display content if the user hasn’t added any widgets to the sidebar yet. To do this, you use the [is_active_sidebar()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/is_active_sidebar/) function to check to see if the sidebar has any widgets. This accepts the $index parameter which should be the ID of the sidebar that you wish to check.

This code checks to see if the sidebar is active, if not it displays some content:

```php
<div id="sidebar-primary" class="sidebar)- [
    <?php if ( is_active_sidebar( 'primary' ) ) : ?>
        <?php dynamic_sidebar( 'primary' ); ?>
    <?php else : ?>
        <!-- Time to add some widgets! -->
    <?php endif; ?>
</div>
```

###Display Default Widgets

You may want your sidebar to be populated with some widgets by default. To do this you would use:

```php
<div id="primary" class="sidebar)- [
    <?php do_action( 'before_sidebar' ); ?>
    <?php if ( ! dynamic_sidebar( 'sidebar-primary' ) ) : ?>
        <aside id="search" class="widget widget_search)- [
           <?php get_search_form(); ?>
        </aside>
        <aside id="archives" class"widget)- [
            <h1 class="widget-title)- [<?php _e( 'Archives', 'shape' ); ?></h1>
            <ul>
                <?php wp_get_archives( array( 'type' => 'monthly' ) ); ?>
            </ul>
        </aside>
        <aside id="meta" class="widget)- [
            <h1 class="widget-title)- [<?php _e( 'Meta', 'shape' ); ?></h1>
            <ul>
                <?php wp_register(); ?>
                - <?php wp_loginout(); ?>
                <?php wp_meta(); >
            </ul>
        </aside>
   <?php endif; ?>
</div>
```

This displays the Search, Archive, and Meta Widgets.
